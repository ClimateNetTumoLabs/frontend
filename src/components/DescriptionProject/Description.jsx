                            TUMO Boxes are low-cost and easy-to-deploy facilities built out of shipping containers. Strategically placed so that every teen in Armenia can reach one in 40 minutes or less, these self-contained learning environments are equipped with state-of-the-art workstations and equipment and can host up to 320 students per week.  The boxes provide access to the TUMO program and the entire network of coaches. These satellite locations act as the foundation for the ClimateNet devices. The devices are deployed on these boxes across the country to provide us with the local and accurate data.workshop leaders, and fellow students.
